<a href="int21.html#ah=0ah" class="ttydoc">INT 21h</a> AH=0AH Buffered Line Input (DOS 1.0+)
─────────────────────────────────────────────

Input:
    AH = 0Ah
    DS:DX = FAR 16:16 Pointer to buffer structure

    Buffer input:

        - buffer_length must be length of buffer[] field

        - input_length is set to the number of chars from prior input which
          may be recalled, excluding the carriage return. if there is no prior
          input, set to zero.

        - buffer[] can contain prior input to recall if input_length != 0

Output:
    Buffer = structure updated with user input

    Buffer output:

        - buffer_length is unchanged from input

        - input_length is set to the number of chars actually read, excluding
          the carriage return.

        - buffer[] contains the characters actually read, including the
          carriage return.

Buffer structure:

    struct dos_buffered_structure { /* byte packed */
        uint8_t     buffer_length;          /* +0x00 */
        uint8_t     input_length;           /* +0x01 */
        char        buffer[buffer_length];  /* +0x02 */
    };

    buffer_length:      maximum characters the buffer can hold

    input_length:       number of characters actually held in the buffer
                        (length of the string held in the buffer)

    buffer[]:           actual characters in the buffer, including carriage
                        return. this string is NOT NUL-terminated.

Action:

    Read characters and fill in the buffer, until carriage return.

Notes:

    DOS checks for CTRL+C and CTRL+Break keys and executes INT 23h if read.

    If the maximum buffer size is set to 00H, the call returns immediately
    without reading any input.

    Standard input is normally the keyboard. Under DOS 2.0 and higher, standard
    input can be redirected.
