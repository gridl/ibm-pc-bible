─────────────────────────────────────────────

Input:
    AH = 00h
    CS = PSP segment

Output:
    Does not return

Action:
    Terminates the calling DOS process.

    The program's return code (ERRORLEVEL) is set to 00H.

    DOS will perform whatever cleanup it needs to do (including restoring
    INT 22H through 24H from the PSP structure at CS:0000H) and then
    execute the code stored at the (restored) INT 22h.

Notes:

    Microsoft recommends using INT 21 AH=4CH for DOS 2.0 and higher.

    This function is intended for use by .COM programs.

    Documented DOS cleanup actions are:
        - Flush the file buffers and close files, unlocking any regions locked
          by the program.

        - Restores INT 22H (terminate address) from CS:000AH of the PSP.

        - Restores INT 23H (CTRL+C handler) from CS:000EH of the PSP.

        - Restores INT 24H (Critical error handler) from CS:0012H of the PSP.

        - Frees any memory owned by the terminating program.

    After cleanup, DOS transfers control to the INT 22H address that it restored
    from CS:000AH of the PSP.

    If the PSP is it's own parent, the process's memory is not freed.
    If INT 22h points into the terminating program, the process is effectively
    NOT terminated.

    This call is not supported by the Microsoft Windows 3.0 DOSX.EXE
    DOS extender.
